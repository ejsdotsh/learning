# Allowlisting gitignore template for GO projects prevents us
# from adding various unwanted local files, such as generated
# files, developer configurations or IDE-specific files etc.
#
# Recommended: Go.AllowList.gitignore

# Ignore everything

# But not these files...
!/.gitignore

!*.go
!go.sum
!go.mod
!go.work

!*.md
!LICENSE
!Makefile

!*.html
